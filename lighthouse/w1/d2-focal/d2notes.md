* Day 2 Notes 
------------------------------
** Tools we use 

terminal 
editors we use vscode 

** GIT <-----------

we should be perfinshent in git 

what is version control ? 
  records of your program/code/file at specifc stages in time 
    when you create a file / directory the first thing you should do is git init (it will track all the things that you do aka a version control)

    next step is to git commit - m "the changes and commit"

    git status tell you what you have modifed in the file/diretory, to get more information on the changes that you made you would git diff 

    so we use the command git add to add all the changes to your local repostiory  

    to commit the whole repository the command is git add. which would push the whole repository
